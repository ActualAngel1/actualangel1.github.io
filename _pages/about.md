> “It is possible to write endlessly about elliptic curves. (This is not a threat.)” - Serge Lang.

Welcome! I'm preemptible. Usually going either under that handle or as ```frobenius_endomorphism()```.

I am interested in elliptic curves $\to$ [Crypto](https://cryptoisnotcryptocurrency) as well. 

I also do [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and play [CTFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A).

Other than that, I play osu!, read comic books and do competitive programming (rarely, but it's nice).

I use [pypy](https://www.pypy.org) for computational math (Project Euler, Crypto etc...) and [D](https://dlang.org) for competitive programming.
